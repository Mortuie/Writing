# Webpack 4 with React, React Router Integration

## Introduction

This will guide will outline all the findings I have made recently with webpack 4, react & react-router. There have been some tricky bits and stuff I had to search for. I even switched over to parcel because I was having some problems with webpack. However webpack is just more versatile. Parcel is also a very new and recent bundler with a couple of bugs that are yet to be fixed. But if you just want to get your head around bundling to start with it's a cool starter option.

## Problems I encountered

React/Basic loaders were actually quite easy to setup and get my head around. However once I got into more advanced `React` by using react-router-dom etc... the basic setup stopped working. I had to google and use stackoverflow to try and answer and understand my questions.
